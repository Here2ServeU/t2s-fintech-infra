# Deploying the `t2s-fintech-infra` Infrastructure

## Introduction

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for deploying the **T2S FinTech Infrastructure** using **Terraform** on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. The infrastructure supports a software accounting and payroll platform, integrating security, scalability, compliance, microservices, and event-driven architecture. It includes modules for networking, security, databases, Lambda APIs, containers, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

---

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure the following tools are installed:

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### AWS Configuration

Run the following command and enter your credentials:

```bash
aws configure
```

Provide:
- AWS Access Key ID
- AWS Secret Access Key
- Default region: `us-east-1` (or any region where to deploy)
- Output format: `json`

---

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/t2s-fintech-infra.git
cd t2s-fintech-infra
```

---

### Step 2: Bootstrap the Remote Backend

This step provisions the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table used to store and lock Terraform state.

```bash
cd environments/bootstrap
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

This step is only required once per AWS account.

---

### Step 3: Deploy the Dev Environment

```bash
cd ../../environments/dev
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

You can remove `-auto-approve` for manual approval.

---

### Step 4: Deploy Stage and Prod Environments

Repeat the following steps for both `stage` and `prod`.

Example for Stage:

```bash
cd ../../environments/stage
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

Example for Production:

```bash
cd ../../environments/prod
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

---

### Step 5: Configure GitHub Actions CI/CD

1. Push the project to GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions**.
3. Add the following repository secrets:
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

4. Push changes to the `main` branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial infrastructure setup"
git push origin main
```

This triggers the GitHub Actions workflow:
- Format check
- Validate configuration
- Plan and apply changes to AWS

---

## Optional Enhancements

- Use [Terraform Cloud](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs) for remote execution and team workflows
- Add Slack or email notifications to CI/CD pipeline
- Upload Lambda functions to S3 and use `s3_bucket` + `s3_key`
- Integrate AWS Config and CloudTrail for auditing and compliance

## Summary

| Step               | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Bootstrap          | Sets up remote S3 state and locking              |
| Dev Deployment     | Deploys full infrastructure in `dev`             |
| Stage/Prod         | Same modules with different variables            |
| GitHub Actions     | Automates validation and deployment              |
| GitHub Secrets     | Manages AWS credentials securely                 |

---

## Use Cases

The `t2s-fintech-infra` setup is ideal for:

- **FinTech Startups** needing PCI-DSS & SOC2-compliant infrastructure
